        <h4>Motive

        </h4><br/>
The reason for creating this dashboard was to complement the well-known dashboards in the country by providing an unique perpective.tooltip
Basically I personally had a question like: "What about the trends in different states of India?", "Is the virus spread (growth factor) slowing down?", "How I can compare the recovered/deaths dynamics per-state?", "Which states are doing the proper things to slow down the growth-factor".

The dashboard provides a basic functionality of comparing the charts of different states simultaneously. It also has a world page for country comparison. A maps page is provided for visual comparison of states.
